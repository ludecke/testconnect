MoreThan255 = Edgar Allan Poe was an American writer, editor, and literary critic. Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories,+
 particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United+
 States and of American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short stor+
 y. He is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to+
  the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to earn a living through writing a+
  lone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career. Poe was born in Boston, the second child of actors David +
  and Elizabeth "Eliza" Arnold Hopkins Poe. His father abandoned the family in 1810, and his mother died the following +
  year. Thus orphaned, the child was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond, Virginia. They never formally adop+
  ted him, but he was with them well into young adulthood. Tension developed later as John Allan and Edgar Poe repeatedl+
  y clashed over debts, including those incurred by gambling, and the cost of Poe's secondary education. He attended th+
  e University of Virginia but left after a year due to lack of money. Edgar Poe quarreled with+
 John Allan over the funds for his education and enlisted in the Army in 1827 under an assumed name.
