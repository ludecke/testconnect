MoreThan255 = Edgar Allan Poe was an American writer, editor, and literary critic. Poe is best known for his poetry and+
 short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romantici+
sm in the United States and of American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of+
 the short stor y. He is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with c+
ontributing to  the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to earn a living thro+
ugh writing a  lone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career. Poe was born in Boston, the second child of a+
ctors David   and Elizabeth "Eliza" Arnold Hopkins Poe. His father abandoned the family in 1810, and his mother died the+
 following   year. Thus orphaned, the child was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond, Virginia. They never for+
mally adop  ted him, but he was with them well into young adulthood. Tension developed later as John Allan and Edgar Poe+
 repeatedl  y clashed over debts, including those incurred by gambling, and the cost of Poe's secondary education. He at+
tended th  e University of Virginia but left after a year due to lack of money. Edgar Poe quarreled with John Allan over+
 the funds for his education and enlisted in the Army in 1827 under an assumed name.
